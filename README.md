### Usages
1. Ensure the script is saved, e.g., `pvpn.sh`.
2. Make the script executable:
    ```sh
    chmod +x pvpn.sh
    ```
3. Run the script with the appropriate argument:
    ```sh
    ./pvpn.sh us
    ```
4. For Linux

Set the file permissions so that only your user can read the file:
```
sh
chmod 600 /path/to/auth.txt
```

Make sure your configuration files are correctly placed in `/path/of/configs` and named accordingly (e.g., `us-free-xxx.protonvpn.udp.ovpn`).
